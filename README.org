* Orgmode file to ghost uploader

Orgmode is my main editor for making note and I wish there is some easy way to upload an org file to the Ghost platform.

This project provides basic function to streamline the process of uploading orgmode file to Ghost.

It served mainly as practice for the Kotlin language but hopefully it can also be of some use for others.
